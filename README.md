hello-world
===========

First repository created on GitHub!

How does this README work? I guess just like a text file?
Let's find out:


  /\_/\
=( °w° )=
  )   (  //
 (__ __)//


So it looks like multiple carriage returns or even spaces don't appear to carry over when the code is committed. I also just noticed there's a preview tab instead of my committing and seeing how that turns out. Oops.
